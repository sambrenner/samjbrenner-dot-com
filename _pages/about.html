<p>Hello and thanks for visiting!</p>

<p>I like to have fun with technology. When I was growing up, that meant Photoshopping my friends' heads on to other people's bodies. These days it means creating online and physical interfaces that explore subjects like technology in museums, Mariah Carey's hand-dances, re-animation of adolescent cyber-corpses and cat mind-control. With occasional time for headswaps.</p>

<p>I am a graduate of the Rochester Insitute of Technology's <a href="http://cias.rit.edu/schools/design/undergraduate-new-media-design-imaging" rel="external">New Media Design</a> program (BFA, 2009) and New York University's <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/" rel="external">Interactive Telecommunications Program</a> (MPS, 2014). You can currently find me at the <a href="http://cooperhewitt.org/" rel="external">Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum</a>, where I work as an <a href="http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/" rel="external">Interactive Media Developer</a>.
