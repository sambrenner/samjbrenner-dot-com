<p>This spring at ITP, I'll be taking <a href="http://o-matic.com/">Marina Zurkow</a>'s "Fungus Among Us." She's asked us to post a little bit about the specific topic we'd like to explore in the class, which for me is windowsill gardening. My windowsill has seen a few plants (both alive and dead) over the past few years and I've always told myself that eventually I'll put some effort into it and make a well-designed, complete garden.</p>
<p>After some preliminary research, there are a few ways I think fungi can help in a windowsill garden. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza">Mycorrhizal fungi</a> are fungi that live symbiotically with plant root systems, and I can explore ways to encourage their growth to benefit herbs, flowers and other plants I would want in my garden. This could involve research into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_food_web">soil food web</a>, which will also be relevant to the "Soil as Medium" class I'll be taking in the second half of this semester. For a more decorative approach, I can attempt to cultivate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen">lichen</a> or grow <a href="http://www.fungi.com/shop/grow-mushrooms-on-logs-and-stumps.html">mushrooms out of logs</a>, and perhaps attempt to make a fungal terrarium.</p>
<p>Updates to come!</p>
