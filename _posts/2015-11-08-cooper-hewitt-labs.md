    At Cooper Hewitt, I develop the infrastructure and interfaces that give the public full access to the Cooper Hewitt's 200,000-object collection. In addition to managing the [collections website](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org), I work to enhance the museum's [interactive experience](http://www.cooperhewitt.org/new-experience) that allows visitors to engage the collection on touch-screen tables and record their visit with our interactive Pen.
    
    You can read more about my work on the [Cooper Hewitt Labs blog](http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/author/sam).
