<p>Swype, an alternate keyboard for Android, has a neat feature where it will try and predict the next word I want to type by offering three suggestions. If you select a word, it will suggest three more. For example, I started by typing "this" and Swype suggested "was," "is," and "will."</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-261" alt="swype_01" src="/assets/swype_01.jpg" width="600" height="517" /></p>
<p><!--more-->I chose "was," and Swype then suggested "the," "a," and "not."</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-262" alt="swype_02" src="/assets/swype_02.jpg" width="600" height="145" /></p>
<p>Continuing to pick the first suggestion, I came up with this sentence: "This was the only thing I can tell them to be the best of luck with your friends to be the best of luck...," and then it carried on in a loop of "to be the best of luck with your friends."</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-263" alt="swype_03" src="/assets/swype_03.jpg" width="600" height="107" /></p>
<p>This makes for some wonderfully bizarre sentences. Only choosing the first suggestion leads to sentences starting over within themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>Understand that you are not be a great way for a few days later this month of May and the rest is a good thing to say about this year old daughter.</p>
<p>Take the lead of a bit of an individual who has a new study shows the first place in a way that is not the only thing I can tell them to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then choosing my favorite of the three suggestions allows me to craft (slightly) more coherent sentences:</p>
<blockquote><p>Give me the opportunity to make sure that your operating systems are not the only way to get to know what I have to do.</p>
<p>Bring your business to business and technology to help them make it easier for you to be able to get the latest version of a new one.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also knows current affairs, kind of. I had some fun with titles: "President" brings up "Bush," "Barack," and "Obama." "Prime Minister" only suggests one name "Gordon," referring to Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2010. "Commissioner" brings up only one name, "Roger," referring to Roger Goodell, Commissioner of the NFL. But along with suggesting "Goodell," it suggests "Clemens" (the baseball pitcher) and "Federer" (the tennis player). "Roger" on its own, without "Commissioner," suggests "Ebert" instead of "Goodell."</p>
