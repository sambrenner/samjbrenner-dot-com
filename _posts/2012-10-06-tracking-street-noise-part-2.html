<p><a href="http://samjbrenner.com/notes/tracking-street-noise-on-6th-avenue-part-1-or-why-i-need-earplugs-to-sleep/">See part 1.</a> Quick update. Today I built an "enclosure" for my sound sensor. Behold:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174" title="PA062147" src="/assets/PA062147.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>The microphone is set back because of how closely I initially soldered it to the PCB. This was impacting the microphone's ability to capture sound, so after taking the pictures I went back and resoldered it so that it's flush with the wood. Next steps will be to modifying my Processing sketch to output a CSV file of all the sensor readings so I can run it for hours and analyze it later.</p>
