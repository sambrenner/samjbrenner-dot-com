<p>A few months ago, I asked myself this question:</p>
<blockquote><p>How many times in my entire life have I heard Bon Jovi'sÂ <em>Livin' on a Prayer</em>?</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not only talking about a last.fm-style log of how many times I've played it (answer: 0) - I'm talking about those awkward years I only listened to classic rock radio, the hours of other people's karaoke I've endured or even just a casual sit-down in a diner. It's not so much how many times have I heard it, but specifically how many times have I been in its presence? I figure it has to be at least 500, if not close to 1,000.</p>

<p>Why I chose this song in particular I'm not sure, but it's quite fitting. When I was born in 1987, <em>Livin' on a Prayer</em> was in its first week on the Billboard "Mainstream Rock" chart, where it would spend one more week before moving to a four week stint atop the Billboard Hot 100. I think it's safe to assume that I heard this song quite a bit during my initial formative weeks. This leads me to:</p>
<h2>My New Year's Resolution</h2>
<p>In 2013, I resolve to track every time I hear this song. I've spent the last two months training myself to constantly be mindful of the song and I've gotten pretty good - even people mentioning the song in passing triggers me to remember I'm supposed to be keeping track of it. And obviously I won't know if I missed any, but I have to trust my consciousness to do its job (so if you see me spacing out at all this next year, that's just me waiting for Jon to tell me what I want to hear. Hopefully at the end of the year, I'll be able to extrapolate the data out to a whole lifetime's worth of hearing this song.</p>
<p>Since I'm both the observer and subject of this experiment, it will very likely be subject to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect">expectancy bias</a>, which I don't think will be entirely possible to avoid. But I will not actively seek the song out, nor will I go anywhere for the express purpose of hearing the song. I will go to karaoke as much as I've always gone (rarely), and go to as many Bon Jovi concerts, cover band or real band, as I've ever been to (zero).</p>
