<p>My final project for Understanding Genomes, tentatively titled "I Dream of Gene," will imagine what tools in the future will exist to help us share (or steal) genetic information. The project will involve the production of a few prototypes - here are a few initial sketches of what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>One object I'm really excited about making is the boxy-looking thing in the center. It's inspired by J. Craig Venter's "<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/429662/genome-hunters-go-after-martian-dna/">biological teleporter</a>": a way to sequence martian DNA, transmit the sequence to earth and then synthesize it artificially. One day, might every kitchen have a biological teleporter capable of downloading a DNA sequence and synthesizing it or even its coded proteins? As part of my project I want to prototype the form of the machine, but also imagine how the end user experiences this machine on a day-to-day basis. For example, a DNA synthesizer hooked up to the internet would surely be inundated with spam emails for penis enlargement, no?</p>
