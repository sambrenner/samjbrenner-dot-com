<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5dtq8xt_Y0sTnpXT2hHcFB2TEk">Community Composting Policy Paper</a> feels like an appropriate balance between change that needs to happen from below and change needed from above. I often refer to a lecture from my undergrad days in which he bemoaned awareness-based campaigns that place the responsibility to solve big problems on the citizen. His specific example was "<a href="http://www.smokeybear.com/">Only You Can Prevent Wildfires</a>," which looks at a systemic problem from a vastly oversimplified view and attempts to free the government of responsibility in the mind of the citizen. With its power of policy, there is a great deal the government can do to prevent forest fires.</p>
<p>That is why it's exciting to see how the Composting Roundtable has set its sights on both ends of the spectrum. To see high-level change as necessary and to have a plan to approach it is necessary in anything that wants to tackle environmental issues. Even to achieve their stated goal of a tightly-closed loop, they will have to make changes outside of that loop. This will better enable them to the bottom-up changes that are also necessary in composting that we've discussed in class: making it easier and "prettier."</p>
