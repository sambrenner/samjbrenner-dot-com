<p>The first assignment in Understanding Genomes was to create a dating profile for a randomly-assigned organism. I "have" <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, an STD that is noteworthy for having the smallest known genome to constitute a cell.</p>
<p>I presented its dating profile in the form of a craigslist classified ad, which you can see <a href="http://samjbrenner.com/projects/genomes/datingprofile.html">here</a>. I had originally wanted to model the syntax and grammar of the ad after what you would <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/m4w/">generally see on craigslist</a> (click at your own risk), but that would have strongly hindered my ability to  communicate the information required for the assignment.</p>
