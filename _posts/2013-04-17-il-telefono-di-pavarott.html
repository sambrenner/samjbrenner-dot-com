<p>My recent assignment for Redial, called "Il Telefono di Pavarotti" (add or remove Os as you wish), transforms the screams of us mere mortals into the rich tenor bellow of one Luciano Pavarotti. Just turn up your volume, visit <a href="http://pavarotti.samjbrenner.com/">the website</a> and call (360) 215-1975. Once your Pavatar appears, scream!</p>
<p>Here's what the classroom sounded like when I presented it last week (thanks to <a href="http://aaron-sherwood.com/">Aaron</a> for being documentation-minded):</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I presented the site a small JavaScript bug prevented my desired functionality of one Pavarotti per caller (you can see in the image below that some got grouped together). It's a really dumb bug that I should have seen coming, but this was just a homework assignment so I'm not too worried about it.</p>
<p>This was built with the help of Chris's <a href="https://github.com/itp-redial/tinyphone">Tinyphone</a> library.</p>

<p>And some bonus content! A by-product of having extracted Pavarotti's B4 from eight videos:</p>
