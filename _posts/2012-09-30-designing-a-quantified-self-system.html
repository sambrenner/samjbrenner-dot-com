<p>One assignment for DIY Health this week was to design two fantasy <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> systems, one that focused on the body and one for something else. For the body, I chose to design a system for tracking back pain. Sensors on the feet and posterior track time spent sitting, standing and reclining. This combines with a user-supplied level of discomfort to identify trends in back pain.</p>

<p>For my non-body system, I chose to track social anxiety. Since it's something subjective (until a world in which we all have embedded brain sensors), I proposed a clicker-based system to discretely track feelings of social discomfort. Each click logs data such as where you are and who you are with to find patterns in anxious feelings.</p>

<p>And in the interest of showing process, here are the relevant pages from my sketchbook as I was brainstorming.</p>

<p>You can see that I was considering another system to track lost items and aid in forgetfulness (I'm always asking myself "did I leave the oven on?" or "did I lock the door?"), but decided against it as I was having difficulty coming up with a way to close the feedback loop and aid the user in the long term. This might be something worth revisiting, however.</p>
<p>NB: I went to scan these images and discovered that my scanner had stopped working. I'll replace the images once the fine people at Epson ship me my replacement, but until then please excuse my contrast-enhanced photos.</p>
