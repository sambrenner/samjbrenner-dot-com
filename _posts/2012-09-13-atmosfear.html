<p>As part of our Applications presentation (see also: <a href="http://samjbrenner.com/notes/building-a-dreamachine/">Dreamachine</a>), I built <a href="http://www.samjbrenner.com/projects/atmosfear">Atmosfear</a>, an atmospheric audio experience made possible by the laptops of our fellow classmates. Everyone was asked to visit the website and select a fear. Their computers then played a series of sounds, mostly taken from <a href="http://www.freesound.org/">freesound.org</a>, which all together created a spooky and discomforting environment for about five minutes. You can <a href="http://www.samjbrenner.com/projects/atmosfear">try it out yourself</a>, though it probably won't be as effective solo as having a hundred other people with you. For that, check out the sound clip below, which I recorded in the auditorium.</p>
