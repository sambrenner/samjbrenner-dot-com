<blockquote>interaction: a cyclic process in which two actors alternately listen, think, and speak.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the first chapter of Chris Crawford's "The Art of Interactive Design," he notes that "it takes two actors to have an interaction" and says that running away from a falling tree branch is a reaction, not an interaction. When using his definition, printed at the top of my post, making the distinction between interaction and reaction is the beginning of a slippery slope. If interaction is a conversation that happens over a period of time, then the tree branch example isn't an appropriate comparison. What led up to that tree branch falling? Maybe the land was over-farmed and lost its ability to retain water, which caused the tree to lose moisture and the branch to dry up and ultimately snap. Over a long period of time, every occurrence is just a reaction to the previous one, and I think together those form an interaction.</p>
<p>Crawford's own definition begins to fall apart further when he begins talking about user interfaces. He talks about the "interaction between user and computer," but what conversation happens there? All computers are just following rules, so there is no listening, thinking or speaking. The human may do that, but the computer just takes the input and follows the rules, and with the same input it will follow the same rules and output the same result every time. And I will avoid getting too heavy by talking about free will, but one could argue that if it was possible to create multiple clones of the same two people, each having all the same experiences as their clones, and to put them in the same environment with all the same variables, then the two test subjects would have the exact same conversation every time.</p>
<p>I would then define interaction thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>interaction: a collection of actions and reactions over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>By defining interaction as a collection of actions and reactions, it allows us to call the "interaction between user and computer" a true interaction. The computer may just be following rules, but a human came up with those rules, and presumably changed some of the rules in reaction to a user test somewhere along the development cycle of the software. When I click a button in my web browser, it's an interaction because of all the actions and reactions that led up to me actually making the "click." And this sets us up to better discuss what makes good interaction.</p>
<p>Brett Victor's "<a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design</a>" makes a great case for what "good" interaction is and can be. Hopefully the premise of his rant, a reaction to the current trend of fingers pointing at over-designed interfaces, will soon be outdated. But as long as the smartphone reigns supreme, we might have to deal with this for a while. It seems that interaction design, a relatively new field that is going through somewhat of a rebirth in the post-Flash, post-Web 2.0 "now-we-actually-care-about-the-user" internet, is just as susceptible to trends as any previously established school of design. Flash sites have their <a href="http://iccmworldwide.org/index2.htm">gratuitous intros</a>. Action movies have their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQwTzoobCYU">ridiculously</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1byZkbNB3Jw#t=0m45s">uninformative</a> UIs. The most important thing to take away from his article, I think, is to try different approaches. Not to stick with the cool-looking, popular choices. You will learn something meaningful when you put thought into your interaction design. Not just "what will this button do?" but "why is this button here?"</p>
