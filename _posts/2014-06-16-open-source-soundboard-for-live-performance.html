<p>Last semester, I needed a bare-bones soundboard to cue up and play sound clips for <a href="/notes/aarplane/">AARPlane</a>, the midterm performance of my Puppets class at ITP. Not knowing my way around pro audio software (which I'm sure makes this a simple task) and seeing that the current landscape of online soundboards consists of awfully-designed holdovers from the days of Flash, I decided to build my own. It's far from full-featured - currently it will just play, pause and replay sound clips - but if you need to need a "world's-dumbest"-style soundboard, I think you should give this a try.</p>
<p>Getting it up and running is straightforward-ish (and definitely needs to be straightforward-er):</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sambrenner/soundboard/archive/master.zip">Download the code from GitHub</a></li>
<li>Create a [cci]sounds[/cci] folder inside of [cci]public[/cci] and place all of your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Audio#Supported_audio_codecs">web-encoded</a> audio files in it (mp3s work fine)</li>
<li>Open the project folder in Terminal and run [cci]npm install[/cci] followed by [cci]node app[/cci]</li>
<li>Point your browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000">127.0.0.1:3000</a></li>
<li>Click a sound to play it! Click again to pause!</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sambrenner/soundboard">GitHub</a>, along with my list of <a href="https://github.com/sambrenner/soundboard/issues">issues</a> (I'm accepting pull requests!).</p>
