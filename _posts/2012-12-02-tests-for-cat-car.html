<p>Cat Car is a cat exercise device. Using a wireless steering wheel, you control a laser mounted on a servo (mounted on a cat). Steering wheel left, laser left, cat left.</p>
<p>I'm using a MPU-6050 "6 degrees of freedom" accelerometer/gyroscope. I will write a long post later detailing all the issues I've encountered (some solved, some I am still dealing with). But for now, here's a little video.</p>
