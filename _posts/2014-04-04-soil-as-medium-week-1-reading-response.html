<p>The two readings, Gershuny and Smille's "The Soul of Soil" and Astera's "The Ideal Soil" present two slightly different approaches to the same idea. They both stress the importance of viewing soil as a complex system in which attempts to squeeze more out of one area (say, increasing yields through artificial fertilization) will crush another area (the ability of soil to absorb and hold on to nutrients).</p>
<p>What I find interesting are the differences in how they explain this concept. "Ideal Soil" reads like a manifesto with its blending of opinion with occasional scientific analysis. While it is important to understand where soil science has been in the past century, "Ideal Soil" comes on quick and heavy with its critique of other schools of thought. You can feel the fire inside the author as he writes it.</p>
<p>"The Soul of Soil," conversely, attempts to paint the same picture but sticks simply to observable truths. They don't hide the complexities of the soil system, but present it so fully and richly that learning all of the players in the system becomes exciting. By explaining soil this way, I feel more "on the side" of the authors. I feel like they want me to learn whereas with "Ideal Soil" I felt like I was trying to be made to think a certain way. It is surely important to consider the culture of soil as much as the soil itself, but to do so in the way that "Ideal Soil" does is, in my opinion, not the right way.</p>
