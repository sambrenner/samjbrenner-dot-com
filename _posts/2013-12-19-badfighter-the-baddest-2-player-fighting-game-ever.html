    A two-player browser-based fighting game that I built with <a href="http://michaelpallison.com/" rel="external">Mike Allison</a>. We were inspired by “bad physics” games like <a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html" rel="external">QWOP</a> and <a href="http://www.gravitysensation.com/sumotori/" rel="external">Sumitori Dreams</a> and wanted to capture those awkward character motions while maintaining a quick and easy experience for players.

    You can [play the game](https://badfighter.herokuapp.com/) or [view the source code](https://github.com/sambrenner/badfighter/).

We built it using <a href="http://threejs.org" target="_blank">Three.js</a> and <a href="http://chandlerprall.github.io/Physijs/" target="_blank">Physijs</a>. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sambrenner/badfighter" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and I encourage you to go check it out and help make our game better!
