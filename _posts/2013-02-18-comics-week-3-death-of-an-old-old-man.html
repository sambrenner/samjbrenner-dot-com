<p>This week in Comics we had to take Roald Dahl's short story "<em>Death of an Old Old Man</em>," about a fighter pilot's last flight, and retell it in six frames. This was a tough exercise - it was difficult to convey the protagonist's readiness for death despite the talent he still possesses, so I feel like the change in tone between the fifth and sixth frames is not exactly what I'd like. I'm happy overall, and drawing planes was a ton of fun. Click the image for a larger version.</p>
