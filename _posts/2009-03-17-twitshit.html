description: Frustrated with the frequent and odiferous leavings of my roommate's cat, I rigged up a litterbox to tweet every time the cat relieved himself. What I saw as a breakthrough in passive aggression was viewed mostly as a novelty, and my nostrils continued to suffer.

<p>My first project for Physical Computing was to find a creative way to turn an LED on and off using <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>. A while ago, I said that the only way I'll use Twitter (which I think is beyond pointless) was if I could hook it up to our cat's litterbox and have it Tweet every time the cat takes a poop. (Edit: since writing this post, I've signed up for Twitter. Still pointless.) To fulfil the blinking requirement, an LED would light up to signal "the litterbox is occupied" or start flashing to signal "warning: it may smell awful." And that's exactly what I did!</p>
<p>I had first planned to install an ultrasonic sound emitter inside the litterbox to detect if there was something inside. But when I went to Jason to look through his box-o-sensors, I found that the flex sensor would not only be far easier to rig up than the ultrasonic emitter, it would also be far easier to code for as well. The flex sensor outputs a number which tells me if it is bending one way or another - positive for one direction, negative for the other.</p>

<p>Once I wired up the board, I took to writing the code. The Arduino checks three times a second to get the value of the sensor. If it is bending into the litterbox, the LED turns on. If it is bending out of the litterbox, the LED flashes for a few minutes. The Processing code is responsible for posting the Twitter updates, which works like this: the Arduino board is able to broadcast information via the USB port back up to the computer, which Processing listens for -- this is called a serial event. Depending on what the event parameters are, I can tell which direction the sensor is flexed in and post the appropriate tweet using a nifty library called <a href="http://www.winterwell.com/software/jtwitter.php">JTwitter</a>. Here's a screenshot of the programs running on my laptop (technically, Arduino doesn't have to be open for it to work, but it looks cool with them both there):</p>
