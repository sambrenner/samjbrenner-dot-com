<p>My thesis project continues to evolve as I explore the world of online adolescence. I rewrote my thesis proposal statement, originally posted <a href="/notes/sams-amazing-list-a-thesis-project-proposal/">here</a>, to better address the "big ideas" I want to address. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>It can be uncomfortable to revisit adolescent journals, now knowing that they were often nothing more than vapid rants. However, they served a purpose: to establish a sense of self and to define the author's identity both to him/herself and - in an online world - to the public. The public nature of blogging sites old and new help to reinforce this. Furthermore, it enables us, as adults, to recall this transitional adolescent identity in a way that previous generations have not. What does it mean that I can pull up 14-year-old Sam with only a few clicks? That, as a child of the internet era, I am never far from an earlier version of myself?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://sarahrothberg.com/">Sarah</a> suggested I use people's old online journals to allow them to talk to their adolescent selves, so now I've started to explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatterbot">chatbots</a>. Chatbots have been around for decades, from <a href="http://nlp-addiction.com/eliza/">ELIZA</a> in 1966 to the chatbot that I think most of my peers would remember from their adolescence: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmarterChild">SmarterChild</a>. With the ultimate goal of using the corpus of old blog entries to enable a conversation with your prior online self, I'm now building "a chatbot a day" to give me a feel for the capabilities of chatbots and how people want to interact with them. You can talk to my chatbots <a href="http://sambrenner.github.io/chatbot-a-day/">here</a>.</p>
