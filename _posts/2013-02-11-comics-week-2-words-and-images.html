<p>This week's assignment for Comics was to play around with different ways of combining words and images to portray the same scene, specifically following the seven categories outlined in Scott McCloud's <a href="http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/index.html">Understanding Comics</a>. My scene is about narrowly avoiding stepping in dog crap.</p>
