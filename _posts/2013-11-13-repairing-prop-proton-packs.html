<p>Earlier this summer, I repaired four prop proton packs for the <a href="http://minionsofgozer.com">Minions of Gozer</a>, a group that performs Ghostbusters shadowcasts around the NYC area (many thanks to my friend Rachel, a producer of the show, for trusting me with these...). The four unwieldy packs had endured many years of heavy abuse at the hands of the Minions and what started as a few extra screws here and there quickly turned in to an (almost) complete rebuild. I ended up making a new backplate and what is technically called a "<a href="http://www.gbfans.com/wiki/Proton_Pack_Part_Names">cyclotron</a>" for each pack. In the end they were much lighter and more compact, for which the cast was grateful. More pictures below!</p>
