<p>For my final project in Soil as Medium, I followed through on my <a href="/notes/soil-as-medium-final-project-proposal-compost-pile-composter/">proposal</a> for a worm bin designed to look like a pile of compost. Here it is, pictured below:</p>

<p><!--more-->After ordering my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000S6LZBO">Worm Factory</a>, I prepared the wrap graphic from two pictures of a compost pile, tiled into a 20"x40" texture, shown below. This would give me enough material to cover the front, left and right sides of the worm tower.</p>
<p><img alt="compost_texture" src="/assets/compost_texture-800x400.jpg" width="800" height="400" /></p>
<p>Once I had the texture printed out, I cut it to shape and applied the decal to each face of the bin.</p>

<p>I had initially thought of making the <a href="/notes/soil-as-medium-midterm/">fake compost rock</a> from my midterm project. In switching to this more functional execution, I think my initial concept shifted as well. With my midterm project, products from SkyMall re-designed to suppress over-simplification of environmental systems, I was trying to tackle a rhetorical issue. The compost bin speaks both to a more specific audience (museum gift store patrons) and also directly to action rather than thought. If a <a href="http://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/ProductDisplay_Tea%20Bag%20Tea%20Infuser_10451_10001_102565_-1_26669_26671_102616">$30 tea strainer</a> designed to look like its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_bag">&lt; $1 counterpart</a> is how the museum gift shop audience prefers to steep tea, then logically they would also prefer to compost with a $80 (plus my parts and labor) compost bin designed to look like a pile of food scraps.</p>
<p>Here it is in action!</p>
