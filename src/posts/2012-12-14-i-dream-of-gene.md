My final project for Understanding Genomes was an exploration of future ways we might use genetic information. I prototyped two objects, debuting this summer from Brenetics Co.: DNA Mask and DNA Maker.
DNA Mask is a new way to cover your genetic tracks. Instead of wasting time trying to meticulously remove wayward DNA, DNA Mask allows you to cover everything up with a few quick, generalized sprays in the area of genetic interest. Using a proprietary blend of real human DNA, this product guarantees that your individual presence will be undetectable amongst the noise.

The next product is the Brenetics Company&#8217;s DNA Maker. By wirelessly connecting to the Brenetics Online DNA Library, the DNA Maker downloads and synthesizes DNA sequences on demand. Sequences are then inserted into a modified virus so that the user can consume and incorporate the DNA into their genome. Sequences available range from a widow&#8217;s peak ($100) to blue eyes ($2000) to a full head of hair ($10,000).
Like any internet-connected device, however, the DNA Maker is susceptible to malice, and this particular model has been hacked. The system is now only able to produce garbage DNA sequences that claim to have penis enlarging effects.
