[See part 1.][1] Quick update. Today I built an &#8220;enclosure&#8221; for my sound sensor. Behold:

The microphone is set back because of how closely I initially soldered it to the PCB. This was impacting the microphone&#8217;s ability to capture sound, so after taking the pictures I went back and resoldered it so that it&#8217;s flush with the wood. Next steps will be to modifying my Processing sketch to output a CSV file of all the sensor readings so I can run it for hours and analyze it later.
