This spring at ITP, I&#8217;ll be taking [Marina Zurkow][1]&#8216;s &#8220;Fungus Among Us.&#8221; She&#8217;s asked us to post a little bit about the specific topic we&#8217;d like to explore in the class, which for me is windowsill gardening. My windowsill has seen a few plants (both alive and dead) over the past few years and I&#8217;ve always told myself that eventually I&#8217;ll put some effort into it and make a well-designed, complete garden.
After some preliminary research, there are a few ways I think fungi can help in a windowsill garden. [Mycorrhizal fungi][2] are fungi that live symbiotically with plant root systems, and I can explore ways to encourage their growth to benefit herbs, flowers and other plants I would want in my garden. This could involve research into the [soil food web][3], which will also be relevant to the &#8220;Soil as Medium&#8221; class I&#8217;ll be taking in the second half of this semester. For a more decorative approach, I can attempt to cultivate [lichen][4] or grow [mushrooms out of logs][5], and perhaps attempt to make a fungal terrarium.
Updates to come!
