Our midterm show for Puppets and Performing Objects was &#8220;AARPlane,&#8221; a show about the airborne elderly. As a class, we took the show from an idea to the final production in a week. My puppet is Clarabelle, a drunk but endearing old Southern gal with a secret, who shows up around 22:30 in the video.
