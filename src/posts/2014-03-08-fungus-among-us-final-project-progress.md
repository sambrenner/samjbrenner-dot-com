Like the bionts of a lichen (except on a much different timescale), my final project for Fungus class is evolving. Specifically, I&#8217;ve changed my mind on how I want to include humans in the Big Lichen Picture. Instead of incorporating humans literally and visualizing the human-fungal symbiosis, I&#8217;ve decided to take the eight perspectives laid out in Trevor Goward&#8217;s [Re-emergence][1] essay and present them as human-relatable analogies.

I&#8217;ve found that in my capacity as a temporary theoretical lichenologist, philosophical thought seems a lot less intimidating than usual. By examining the lichen from eight different perspectives, I think we can also shed some light on how to view ourselves and our relationship with the systems that compose our existence. My final project has thus become a series of posters that transpose Trevor&#8217;s eight lichen perspectives. I&#8217;ll extrapolate on this in my final presentation, but for now, here is some work-in-progress:
