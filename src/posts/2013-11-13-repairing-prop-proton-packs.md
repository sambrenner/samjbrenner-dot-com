Earlier this summer, I repaired four prop proton packs for the [Minions of Gozer][1], a group that performs Ghostbusters shadowcasts around the NYC area (many thanks to my friend Rachel, a producer of the show, for trusting me with these&#8230;). The four unwieldy packs had endured many years of heavy abuse at the hands of the Minions and what started as a few extra screws here and there quickly turned in to an (almost) complete rebuild. I ended up making a new backplate and what is technically called a &#8220;[cyclotron][2]&#8221; for each pack. In the end they were much lighter and more compact, for which the cast was grateful. More pictures below!
