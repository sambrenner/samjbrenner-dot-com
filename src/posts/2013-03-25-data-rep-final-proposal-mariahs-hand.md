I have some serious, deep, issue-tackling projects nearing completion. This is not one of them. For my final project in Data Representation, I will answer the question &#8220;how does the position of Mariah Carey&#8217;s flailing hand relate to the pitch of her voice?&#8221;

## Background

At first, I thought the hand-waving thing was a stereotype among the female vocalists known as &#8220;Divas,&#8221; and that it would be fun to analyze these motions in some way. I did some research and found that Mariah is the only one who consistently waves her hand in the way I&#8217;m after: where Y position roughly corresponds to pitch. Some other Divas have their own mid-song tics: Christina [plays the trumpet][1] with her microphone (that&#8217;s a whole other idea in itself&#8230;) and Celine does [this,][2] but for this project I will just be focusing on Mariah.

Also, this is a good time to give the Major Hat Tip to [White Glove Tracking][3] &#8211; I can&#8217;t exactly measure the great influence this project has had on my work, but it&#8217;s probably around two dozen.

## The Data

I spent hours watching Mariah&#8217;s concert footage on YouTube trying to find the perfect clip to exemplify her arm-dance. Most of the clips show it for a few seconds and then cut away to a wider or closer shot. But on I searched, and search I did, and then I found it - 40 seconds of uninterrupted movement. The camera dollies and zooms in a bit, but her hand is visible the whole time, its range of movement as wide as Mariah&#8217;s range of notes. I&#8217;m currently in the middle of going through the clip, frame by frame, to get her hand&#8217;s position using After Effects (see image at the top of the post). That, plus the actual note she is singing, will comprise my data set.

## The Representation

I have a few ideas of how I want to show the data. Their common foundation will be the difference between the note she is actually singing and she note she should be singing according to her hand. I&#8217;ll be able to figure that out by mapping her hand&#8217;s Y coordinate from the range of [lowest hand Y, highest hand Y] to the range of [lowest note sung, highest note sung].

The &#8220;big execution&#8221; that I&#8217;d like to pull off would be to transcribe the notes she should be singing to sheet music and find a vocalist who can sing them back over the original video.

To be continued!
