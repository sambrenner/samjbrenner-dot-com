Delfanti&#8217;s message in [Biohackers][1] is obscured by his conflation of the many different &#8220;breeds&#8221; of hacker into one type of core person. The tinkerer-hacker&#8217;s ethos is not necessarily the same as that of a person trying to hack into a database, for example. Taking what today is nothing more than a buzzword and using it as a central point of reference to talk about how technology and an open-source culture can change science ultimately hinders Delfanti&#8217;s message.
On the point of increasing dissemination of information in the science world, I feel that today&#8217;s focus on user-centered design will, as a result of collaboration with scientists, produce tools that are far more effective at disseminating information than the clunky legacy formats we often encounter. The time is now right to use web technologies to improve the ability of a scientific journal to spread research and promote discussion, for example.
Another point Delfanti skirts around, and Malina addresses a bit more directly, is around education. This is where I personally feel that the ITP community in particular can be the most effective. In working with scientists or scholars, we can craft experiences for the public that can tell the stories as broad as tech patents to as narrow as any specific researcher&#8217;s work. Art, technology and science have been getting closer together for centuries and we, as the current practitioners of this emergent field, have a great opportunity to break down barriers and open these fields to all.
