My final project for Understanding Genomes, tentatively titled &#8220;I Dream of Gene,&#8221; will imagine what tools in the future will exist to help us share (or steal) genetic information. The project will involve the production of a few prototypes &#8211; here are a few initial sketches of what I&#8217;m thinking.

One object I&#8217;m really excited about making is the boxy-looking thing in the center. It&#8217;s inspired by J. Craig Venter&#8217;s &#8220;[biological teleporter][1]&#8220;: a way to sequence martian DNA, transmit the sequence to earth and then synthesize it artificially. One day, might every kitchen have a biological teleporter capable of downloading a DNA sequence and synthesizing it or even its coded proteins? As part of my project I want to prototype the form of the machine, but also imagine how the end user experiences this machine on a day-to-day basis. For example, a DNA synthesizer hooked up to the internet would surely be inundated with spam emails for penis enlargement, no?
