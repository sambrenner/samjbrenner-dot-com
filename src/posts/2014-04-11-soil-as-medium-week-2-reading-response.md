In a way, the criticism that Darwin received for studying and proposing theories around worms and soil creation predicted the oversimplification and ignorance that Astera responds to in his writing from last week. That Darwin&#8217;s peers would not be able to conceive of earthworms, in all their abundance and over a long period of time, being able to change the earth seems unscientific in thought. Though Darwin&#8217;s writing does read like it is a pet topic, jumping excitedly from experiment to experiment, Montgomery&#8217;s description of the book&#8217;s cool reception is surprising.
Darwin&#8217;s resulting theories from his earthworm studies are a simple and thoughtful way of describing one aspect of a complex system. I wonder what theories Darwin&#8217;s critics would have put forward instead for describing the &#8220;life-cycle&#8221; of soil?
