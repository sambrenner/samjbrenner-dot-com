For Fungus Among Us, I&#8217;ve focused my research to lichen. Two aspects of lichen I find interesting are:
  * They are a composite organism, a fungus and a photosynthesizer (algae or cyanobacteria) living together as one. In [_Mycelium Running_][1], Paul Stamets says &#8220;after hundreds of millions of years of evolution, fungal alliances have become part of nature&#8217;s body politic. It is time for our species to partake in this ancient mycological wisdom.&#8221; What does lichen look like if we substitute the photosynthesizer with a human? Could anything be gained from a living as massive colony of humans and fungi, each dependent on the other?
  * Lichen grows incredibly slowly. [Lichenometry][2] is the use of lichen to date exposed rock. [This chart][3] ([source][4]) says that 3cm of lichen grown on the Colorado Front Range implies a rock that has been exposed for about 500 years. What strategies can I employ to capture the [beauty of lichen][5] in a garden if I might not live to see it realized?
I&#8217;ve found a [few][6] [lichenologists][7] online that I will reach out to. I just need to figure out what to ask them! [Mike][8] and I have also decided to team up on this part of our research.
