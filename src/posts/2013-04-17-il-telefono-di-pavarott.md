My recent assignment for Redial, called &#8220;Il Telefono di Pavarotti&#8221; (add or remove Os as you wish), transforms the screams of us mere mortals into the rich tenor bellow of one Luciano Pavarotti. Just turn up your volume, visit [the website][1] and call (360) 215-1975. Once your Pavatar appears, scream!

Here&#8217;s what the classroom sounded like when I presented it last week (thanks to [Aaron][2] for being documentation-minded):

<audio id="wp\_mep\_2" src="/img/uploads/2013/04/pavarotti.mp3" controls="controls" preload="none" > </audio>

Unfortunately, when I presented the site a small JavaScript bug prevented my desired functionality of one Pavarotti per caller (you can see in the image below that some got grouped together). It&#8217;s a really dumb bug that I should have seen coming, but this was just a homework assignment so I&#8217;m not too worried about it.

This was built with the help of Chris&#8217;s [Tinyphone][3] library.

And some bonus content! A by-product of having extracted Pavarotti&#8217;s B4 from eight videos:
