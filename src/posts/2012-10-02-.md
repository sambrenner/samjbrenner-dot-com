Be the Monster lets children bring their drawings to life. After drawing a monster on a sheet of paper, the image is captured and a participant can control it with his or her own body.

I originally had the idea for this when working on our final team project at RIT. This was before the Kinect was out, and I had found some software called [Animata][1] that seemed like it would work. But the full workflow, including drawing, scanning, splitting apart and rigging the monster, still seemed too difficult and we moved on from that idea. Two years later, when I was at [CP+B][2], the Kinect was out and Microsoft&#8217;s official [Kinect SDK][3] had just been released. I was in the shower &#8211; my favorite location for one-man brainstorming sessions &#8211; when realized that the original idea was now doable and, with CP+B&#8217;s backing, I began to build out the prototype.
In addition to the Kinect SDK, I use the [GRATF][4] library for image detection and Atalasoft&#8217;s [DotImage SDK][5] for additional image manipulation.
