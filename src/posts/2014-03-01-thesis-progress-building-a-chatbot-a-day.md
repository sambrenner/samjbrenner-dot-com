My thesis project continues to evolve as I explore the world of online adolescence. I rewrote my thesis proposal statement, originally posted [here][1], to better address the &#8220;big ideas&#8221; I want to address. Here it is:

<blockquote>It can be uncomfortable to revisit adolescent journals, now knowing that they were often nothing more than vapid rants. However, they served a purpose: to establish a sense of self and to define the author&#8217;s identity both to him/herself and &#8211; in an online world &#8211; to the public. The public nature of blogging sites old and new help to reinforce this. Furthermore, it enables us, as adults, to recall this transitional adolescent identity in a way that previous generations have not. What does it mean that I can pull up 14-year-old Sam with only a few clicks? That, as a child of the internet era, I am never far from an earlier version of myself?</blockquote>

[Sarah][2] suggested I use people&#8217;s old online journals to allow them to talk to their adolescent selves, so now I&#8217;ve started to explore [chatbots][3]. Chatbots have been around for decades, from [ELIZA][4] in 1966 to the chatbot that I think most of my peers would remember from their adolescence: [SmarterChild][5]. With the ultimate goal of using the corpus of old blog entries to enable a conversation with your prior online self, I&#8217;m now building &#8220;a chatbot a day&#8221; to give me a feel for the capabilities of chatbots and how people want to interact with them. You can talk to my chatbots [here][6].
