A group of classmates and I will be giving a presentation next week to our Applications class. It will be in response to a presentation we saw last week from Kevin Cunningham of [3-Legged Dog][1], a workspace and accompanying theater group that blends technology with performances and art installations.
As part of our presentation, we built a [Dreamachine][2] &#8211; a device that creates a strobe-like effect to stimulate the eyes. Using plans modified from [10111][3], we spent last Friday afternoon planning and assembling the machine. The plan was blown up to a 50&#8243; square piece of heavy paper which was wrapped around a foam base and supported by some narrow aluminum poles. Watch the video of the finished device below, and click below that to see the construction pictures.
