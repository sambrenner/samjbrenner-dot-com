A few months ago, I asked myself this question:
> How many times in my entire life have I heard Bon Jovi&#8217;s _Livin&#8217; on a Prayer_?
I&#8217;m not only talking about a last.fm-style log of how many times I&#8217;ve played it (answer: 0) &#8211; I&#8217;m talking about those awkward years I only listened to classic rock radio, the hours of other people&#8217;s karaoke I&#8217;ve endured or even just a casual sit-down in a diner. It&#8217;s not so much how many times have I heard it, but specifically how many times have I been in its presence? I figure it has to be at least 500, if not close to 1,000.

Why I chose this song in particular I&#8217;m not sure, but it&#8217;s quite fitting. When I was born in 1987, _Livin&#8217; on a Prayer_ was in its first week on the Billboard &#8220;Mainstream Rock&#8221; chart, where it would spend one more week before moving to a four week stint atop the Billboard Hot 100. I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that I heard this song quite a bit during my initial formative weeks. This leads me to:
## My New Year&#8217;s Resolution
In 2013, I resolve to track every time I hear this song. I&#8217;ve spent the last two months training myself to constantly be mindful of the song and I&#8217;ve gotten pretty good &#8211; even people mentioning the song in passing triggers me to remember I&#8217;m supposed to be keeping track of it. And obviously I won&#8217;t know if I missed any, but I have to trust my consciousness to do its job (so if you see me spacing out at all this next year, that&#8217;s just me waiting for Jon to tell me what I want to hear. Hopefully at the end of the year, I&#8217;ll be able to extrapolate the data out to a whole lifetime&#8217;s worth of hearing this song.
Since I&#8217;m both the observer and subject of this experiment, it will very likely be subject to [expectancy bias][1], which I don&#8217;t think will be entirely possible to avoid. But I will not actively seek the song out, nor will I go anywhere for the express purpose of hearing the song. I will go to karaoke as much as I&#8217;ve always gone (rarely), and go to as many Bon Jovi concerts, cover band or real band, as I&#8217;ve ever been to (zero).
