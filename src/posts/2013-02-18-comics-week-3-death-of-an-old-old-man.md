This week in Comics we had to take Roald Dahl&#8217;s short story &#8220;_Death of an Old Old Man_,&#8221; about a fighter pilot&#8217;s last flight, and retell it in six frames. This was a tough exercise &#8211; it was difficult to convey the protagonist&#8217;s readiness for death despite the talent he still possesses, so I feel like the change in tone between the fifth and sixth frames is not exactly what I&#8217;d like. I&#8217;m happy overall, and drawing planes was a ton of fun. Click the image for a larger version.
