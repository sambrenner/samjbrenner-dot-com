Swype, an alternate keyboard for Android, has a neat feature where it will try and predict the next word I want to type by offering three suggestions. If you select a word, it will suggest three more. For example, I started by typing &#8220;this&#8221; and Swype suggested &#8220;was,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; and &#8220;will.&#8221;

<!--more-->I chose &#8220;was,&#8221; and Swype then suggested &#8220;the,&#8221; &#8220;a,&#8221; and &#8220;not.&#8221;

Continuing to pick the first suggestion, I came up with this sentence: &#8220;This was the only thing I can tell them to be the best of luck with your friends to be the best of luck&#8230;,&#8221; and then it carried on in a loop of &#8220;to be the best of luck with your friends.&#8221;

This makes for some wonderfully bizarre sentences. Only choosing the first suggestion leads to sentences starting over within themselves:
> Understand that you are not be a great way for a few days later this month of May and the rest is a good thing to say about this year old daughter.
>
> Take the lead of a bit of an individual who has a new study shows the first place in a way that is not the only thing I can tell them to be.
And then choosing my favorite of the three suggestions allows me to craft (slightly) more coherent sentences:
> Give me the opportunity to make sure that your operating systems are not the only way to get to know what I have to do.
>
> Bring your business to business and technology to help them make it easier for you to be able to get the latest version of a new one.
It also knows current affairs, kind of. I had some fun with titles: &#8220;President&#8221; brings up &#8220;Bush,&#8221; &#8220;Barack,&#8221; and &#8220;Obama.&#8221; &#8220;Prime Minister&#8221; only suggests one name &#8220;Gordon,&#8221; referring to Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2010. &#8220;Commissioner&#8221; brings up only one name, &#8220;Roger,&#8221; referring to Roger Goodell, Commissioner of the NFL. But along with suggesting &#8220;Goodell,&#8221; it suggests &#8220;Clemens&#8221; (the baseball pitcher) and &#8220;Federer&#8221; (the tennis player). &#8220;Roger&#8221; on its own, without &#8220;Commissioner,&#8221; suggests &#8220;Ebert&#8221; instead of &#8220;Goodell.&#8221;
