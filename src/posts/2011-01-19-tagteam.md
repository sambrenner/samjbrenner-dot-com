What started off as the&nbsp;<a href="/notes/beginning-node-js-and-socket-io/">world's dumbest chatroom</a> a few weeks ago is gradually turning into something cooler. "Tag Team," as I’m calling it (for now), lets a writer and a drawer collaborate on whatever they would like. I’ve put my updated source on <a href="https://github.com/sambrenner/tagteam">GitHub</a> so you can play around with it yourself. Here are some next steps:

<ul>
<li>Design the site and user experience – tasked to my <a href="http://ameliahall.com/">co-conspirator</a></li>
<li>Get it up online – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110124224232/http://nodester.com/">nodester</a> looks like a good starting point</li>
<li>Optimization – in particular, with how the image is transmitted. Currently I’m encoding the canvas as a png using `canvas.toDataURL()` and sending that over the server, which is a little laggy. I might try seeing only what parts of the encoded string have changed and send that instead.</li>
<li>Security – still really easy to send whatever instructions you want to the server.</li>
</ul>
