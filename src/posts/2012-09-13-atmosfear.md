As part of our Applications presentation (see also: [Dreamachine][1]), I built [Atmosfear][2], an atmospheric audio experience made possible by the laptops of our fellow classmates. Everyone was asked to visit the website and select a fear. Their computers then played a series of sounds, mostly taken from [freesound.org][3], which all together created a spooky and discomforting environment for about five minutes. You can [try it out yourself][2], though it probably won&#8217;t be as effective solo as having a hundred other people with you. For that, check out the sound clip below, which I recorded in the auditorium.
