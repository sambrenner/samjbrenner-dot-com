For my thesis project at ITP, I built <a href="http://teenbloggers.net" target="_blank">The Adventures of Teen Bloggers</a>, a creative-nonfiction graphic adventure that lets you become a real teen blogger from the heyday of LiveJournal.

With the project, I want to highlight the tension between the value our online data has as historical documents and the embarrassment we feel about the things we shared in a prior phase of our lives.

Upon starting the game, players are asked to pick a LiveJournal account. Any extant LiveJournal is a playable character in the game, though I encourageÂ players to play with their own account if they had one. Players are then placed in a high school hallway, where they must navigate the world only saying things that their selected LiveJournal user wrote on their blog.

The game is a work in progress as I continue to research online archiving. Specific next steps are outlined on <a href="https://github.com/sambrenner/teenbloggers/issues?page=1&state=open" target="_blank">Github</a>; the <a href="https://github.com/sambrenner/teenbloggers/" target="_blank">source code</a> for the project is there as well. You can play the game <a href="http://teenbloggers.net" target="_blank">here</a>.

Below is the presentation I gave on the project during ITP&#8217;s Thesis Week.
