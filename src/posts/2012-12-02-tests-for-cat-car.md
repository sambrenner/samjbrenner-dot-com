Cat Car is a cat exercise device. Using a wireless steering wheel, you control a laser mounted on a servo (mounted on a cat). Steering wheel left, laser left, cat left.

I&#8217;m using a MPU-6050 &#8220;6 degrees of freedom&#8221; accelerometer/gyroscope. I will write a long post later detailing all the issues I&#8217;ve encountered (some solved, some I am still dealing with). But for now, here&#8217;s a little video.
