The first assignment in Understanding Genomes was to create a dating profile for a randomly-assigned organism. I &#8220;have&#8221; _Mycoplasma genitalium_, an STD that is noteworthy for having the smallest known genome to constitute a cell.
I presented its dating profile in the form of a craigslist classified ad, which you can see [here][1]. I had originally wanted to model the syntax and grammar of the ad after what you would [generally see on craigslist][2] (click at your own risk), but that would have strongly hindered my ability to  communicate the information required for the assignment.
