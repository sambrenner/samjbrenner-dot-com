[BadFighter][1] is a two-player fighting game created by myself and <a href="http://michaelpallison.com/" target="_blank">Mike Allison</a> for the Interactive 3D workgroup at ITP. We built it using <a href="http://threejs.org" target="_blank">Three.js</a> and <a href="http://chandlerprall.github.io/Physijs/" target="_blank">Physijs</a>. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sambrenner/badfighter" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and I encourage you to go check it out and help make our game better! If you don&#8217;t know where to start, I recommend [Udacity&#8217;s Interactive 3D course][2], which was the basis of our workgroup.

We were inspired by &#8220;bad physics&#8221; games/mods like <a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html" target="_blank">QWOP</a>, <a href="http://www.gravitysensation.com/sumotori/" target="_blank">Sumotori Dreams</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AemxS2Xtbo8" target="_blank">The Life and Times of Qarpess</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-620xx7yTo" target="_blank">Carmageddon</a>, and wanted to capture those awkward character motions while maintaining a quick and easy experience for players.

Grab a friend and [play the game now][1]!
