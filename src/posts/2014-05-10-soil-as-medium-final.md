For my final project in Soil as Medium, I followed through on my [proposal][1] for a worm bin designed to look like a pile of compost. Here it is, pictured below:

After ordering my [Worm Factory][2], I prepared the wrap graphic from two pictures of a compost pile, tiled into a 20&#8243;x40&#8243; texture, shown below. This would give me enough material to cover the front, left and right sides of the worm tower.

Once I had the texture printed out, I cut it to shape and applied the decal to each face of the bin.

I had initially thought of making the [fake compost rock][3] from my midterm project. In switching to this more functional execution, I think my initial concept shifted as well. With my midterm project, products from SkyMall re-designed to suppress over-simplification of environmental systems, I was trying to tackle a rhetorical issue. The compost bin speaks both to a more specific audience (museum gift store patrons) and also directly to action rather than thought. If a [$30 tea strainer][4] designed to look like its [< $1 counterpart][5] is how the museum gift shop audience prefers to steep tea, then logically they would also prefer to compost with a $80 (plus my parts and labor) compost bin designed to look like a pile of food scraps.
Here it is in action!
