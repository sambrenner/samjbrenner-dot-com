Hey internet, watch out! I can now produce these:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-348" alt="civilwar" src="/img/uploads/2013/03/civilwar.gif"  />][1]

I used [TileMill][2] to color the states according to their Civil War allegiances, and [Processing][3] with [Unfolding][4] to place the dots. That dot way off in Idaho (Washington Territory at the time) is the site of the [Bear River Massacre][5].
