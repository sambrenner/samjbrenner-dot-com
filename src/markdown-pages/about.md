Hello and thanks for visiting!

I am a software engineer with over 10 years' experience building educational, graphical, and creative tools for the web.

I like to have fun with technology. When I was growing up, that meant Photoshopping my friends' heads on to other people's bodies. More recently, it means creating online and physical interfaces that explore subjects like the regenerative abilities of plant roots, Mariah Carey's hand-dances, the re-animation of forgotten blogs and cat mind-control. With occasional time for headswaps.

I am a graduate of the Rochester Insitute of Technology's New Media Design program (BFA, 2009) and New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program (MPS, 2014). You can currently find me working at [Spotify](https://spotify.com). Before that, I've worked at [CBRE Build](https://cbrebuild.com), [Vidcode](https://vidcode.com), the [Cooper Hewitt Museum](https://cooperhewitt.org), and taught at [Parsons](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-communication-design/).
